# Code 1v1 Tournament Website Manual

Welcome to our Code 1v1 Tournament Website! Below is a comprehensive manual to help you understand our platform and the game in detail.


## Room Creation and Joining:
- To initiate a tournament, users can create a room by clicking on the "Create Room" button.
- Upon creation, a unique room ID will be generated, which can be shared with other users.
- Participants can join a room by entering the provided room ID in the designated field and clicking on "Join Room".

## Admin Privileges:
- The user who creates the room will be designated as the admin.
- Admins have exclusive access to start the tournament and manage its progression.

## Tournament Structure:
- The tournament is organized into rounds, each comprising multiple 1v1 matchups between active players.

## Starting Rounds:
- Only the admin has the authority to start a new round.
- Admins can initiate a round when all participants are ready to compete.

## Player Pairing:
- In each round, players are randomly paired for 1v1 matchups.
- If the number of players is odd, a bot is paired with one randomly chosen player to ensure fair competition.

## Problem Presentation:
- Once paired, participants are presented with a coding problem to solve within a specified time limit.

## Determining Winners:
- The winner of each 1v1 matchup is determined based on the correctness of their code or submission time (if number of testcases passed are equal).

## Advancing to Next Round:
- Winners of each round proceed to the next round, provided the admin initiates another round.

## Inactive Players:
- Players who lose a round become inactive and are unable to progress to subsequent rounds.

## Final Winner:
- The tournament progresses as a binary tree structure, culminating in the declaration of a final winner when only one active player remains.

## Fairness and Transparency:
- Our platform ensures fairness through random pairing, unbiased problem selection, and transparent determination of winners.
